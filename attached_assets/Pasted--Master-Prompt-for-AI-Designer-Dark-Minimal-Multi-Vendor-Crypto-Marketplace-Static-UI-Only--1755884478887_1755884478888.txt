# Master Prompt for AI Designer — Dark Minimal Multi‑Vendor Crypto Marketplace (Static UI Only)

> **Goal**: Design a complete, static, server‑rendered UI for a **multi‑vendor marketplace for trading accounts** with **BTC/XMR** payments, **optional escrow**, **anonymous users**, and a **powerful admin panel**. Start with the **Admin Panel** first, then the **Buyer/Vendor (marketplace) side**.
>
> **important**: Produce **static designs and/or static  (Tailwind preferred)**. **No live data,no API calls**. Use realistic placeholder text/data and clear component states so a backend engineer can wire it later.

## 1) Creative Direction & UX Principles

* **Visual theme**: Dark, modern, minimal, restrained. Avoid bright, kitschy, or e‑commerce‑busy patterns (eBay/Amazon look = ❌). Think elegant, editorial, and spacious. Reference vibe akin to curated dark UI shots on Pinterest.
* **Tone**: Professional, privacy‑first, trustworthy, understated.
* **Accessibility**: Meet WCAG AA for color contrast in dark mode. Provide focus states, keyboard navigable controls, readable sizes.
* **Server‑rendered mindset**: Pages must work without client JS. Progressive enhancement only. Any third‑party widget (e.g., FunCaptcha) appears in a **sandboxed iframe placeholder**.
* **Anonymity & safety**: Avoid collecting PII in UI. Username+password, optional recovery phrase, optional TOTP 2FA. Minimal logs visuals.
* **White‑label**: Prepare a **theming system** (tokens) so instances can swap logo/name/colors.

## 2) Design System (Foundations)

**Color tokens (dark, subtle):**

* `--bg`: #0B0F14 (page), `--surface`: #11161C, `--surface-2`: #141A22
* `--text`: #E6E9EF, `--muted`: #9AA4B2, `--border`: #1E2630
* `--accent`: #22D3EE (reserved, sparing), `--accent-2`: #7DD3FC
* `--success`: #22C55E, `--warning`: #F59E0B, `--danger`: #EF4444

**Typography**

* Primary: Inter/IBM Plex Sans/SF Pro (system stack acceptable)
* Numeric/mono data: Geist Mono/IBM Plex Mono/JetBrains Mono
* Base sizes: 14–16px body, 24–32px section titles, 18px form labels

**Layout**

* 12‑column grid, 1440px max container, generous spacing (16–24px).
* Cards with subtle radius (16–20px) and soft shadows, low elevation.

**Components** (deliver as reusable atoms):

* Buttons (primary, secondary, quiet, destructive, icon‑only)
* Inputs (text, password, textarea, select, combobox, date), with help/error text
* Toggles, checkboxes, radios, segmented controls
* Tables (dense & comfy), pagination, sticky headers
* Badges/Chips (status: Draft, Pending, Live, Banned, Disputed, Escrowed, Released)
* Tabs, accordions, modals, drawers, toasts, empty‑states, skeletons
* Breadcrumbs, topbar, sidebar, filters panel, command palette (static)
* Code/secret blocks with masked state + “reveal” placeholder icon

**States**

* Loading skeletons (static), empty, error, success, disabled, readonly

---

## 9) Deliverables & Output Format (from AI)

* **Primary**: High‑fidelity mockups (desktop first, responsive down to 360px) covering every screen above, **Admin first**.
* **Option A**: Export **static HTML + Tailwind CSS** pages for all screens (no JS needed beyond minor interactions simulated with CSS where possible).
* **Option B**: Figma file with components, variants, and page flows.
* Provide **component library** (buttons, inputs, tables, badges, modals, tabs, skeletons) with states.
* Provide **empty/error/success** states and sample data for tables/lists.
* Include **style guide page** with tokens, type scale, spacing, grid.

---

## 10) Constraints & Non‑Goals

* **Static only** (no dynamic data). Backend wiring will be done later.
* Avoid bright colors, gradients overload, and stock‑ecommerce clutter.
* Keep copy minimal; let whitespace and structure convey clarity.
* No analytics, no tracking scripts, no social sign‑ins.

---

## 11) Acceptance Checklist (what “done” looks like)

* All Admin sections have a designed screen (index + detail where relevant).
* Vendor lifecycle is fully represented: Apply → Pending → Approved → Create listing → Order → Deliver → Payout.
* Buyer lifecycle is fully represented: Browse → Listing → Pay (BTC/XMR) → Escrow → Confirm/Dispute → Review.
* Crypto & Escrow screens clearly explain states with badges and timelines.
* Security & Privacy settings present (2FA, CSP text, sessions, access control).
* White‑label page present and functional (static controls).

---

## 12) Quick Starter Prompts (if the AI needs smaller tasks)

* “Design the **Admin → Vendors → Applications** page with cards, filters, and Approve/Reject modals, dark minimal theme.”
* “Create the **Order detail with escrow timeline**: show order‑specific address, confirmations (static), and admin actions to Release/Refund.”
* “Design **Vendor Dashboard** with Overview, Listings table, New Listing form, Payouts tab — all static.”
* “Produce the **Listing Detail page** for a trading account with Buy in BTC/XMR buttons and a payment modal with QR placeholder.”
* “Build the **Roles & Permissions matrix** with role presets and per‑permission toggles.”

---

### Final Note to AI

Assume **all data is placeholder**. Focus on **clarity, restraint, and security cues**. The backend engineer will connect forms, tables, and actions later. Keep everything **dark, modern, minimal** with strong typographic hierarchy and consistent spacing.
