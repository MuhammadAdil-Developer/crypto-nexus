I want you to build a **complete Admin Panel UI** for a Multi-Vendor Marketplace system.  
The design theme must be **dark, modern, and minimalistic** with TailwindCSS / ShadCN style.  

⚠️ Important: In dark mode, do NOT use very light grey or faint colors for text.  
All text must have **proper contrast** (use white or near-white for readability).  
Headings should be slightly bolder/brighter than body text.  

All pages should be **static placeholders** (no backend logic), but with realistic data tables, forms, and dashboards.  
Navigation should be via a **sidebar menu**. Each sidebar item must open its own dedicated page with the relevant UI.
