Now need to build a Vendor Application process + Vendor Dashboard 

"Design a modern, professional, and secure Vendor Application Flow and Vendor Dashboard UI for a multi-vendor marketplace platform. The UI should follow a futuristic, minimalistic, and grid-based layout with rounded cards, subtle shadows, and a neutral but stylish color palette (white, gray, dark blue, pastel accents). Keep typography consistent, responsive, and easy to read. Add smooth animations and hover states for a premium feel.

üîπ Vendor Application Flow (Inside Buyer Dashboard)

Secret Button ‚Äì Apply as Vendor

In the Buyer Dashboard sidebar (Settings or Profile section), add a hidden/secondary button: "Apply as Vendor".

On click, a Vendor Application Form modal/page opens.

Vendor Application Form Fields

Business/Shop Name

Vendor Username (unique)

Email (pre-filled from buyer profile if available)

Contact (optional)

üëâ Design the form with multi-step wizard style (Step 1: Basic Info, Step 2: Store Info, Step 3: Crypto/Payment Info).

Submission Page

After submitting, redirect to a confirmation page:

Title: "Your Vendor Application Has Been Sent"

Subtext: "Your request is pending admin approval. You will be notified once approved."

Status badge: "Request Pending"

Button: "Go to Vendor Dashboard (Preview Mode)"

üëâ For now (UI demo), clicking "Go to Vendor Dashboard" will open the Vendor Dashboard directly, but in future backend logic, it will remain locked until approved.
